**Tribute Page Project**
**Overview**
This project is a simple and personalized tribute page dedicated to someone I admire. With basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, I designed this webpage to highlight the admirable qualities of my chosen individual. The project allowed me to express my admiration through a visually appealing layout, thoughtful use of typography, and effective content organization.

**Project Features**
Content Structure: The webpage features a well-organized layout, including a header, paragraphs, and sections that describe the individual's life, achievements, and personal qualities.
Styling with CSS: I experimented with various CSS properties to create a visually pleasing design. This includes:
Font Styles: Different font families, sizes, and weights were used to differentiate between headings, subheadings, and body text.
Background Colors: I used background colors to create a contrast between different sections and to emphasize important information.
Images: Relevant images were added to make the page more engaging and to visually represent the person's life and achievements.
Responsive Design: Basic responsive design techniques were implemented to ensure that the page looks good on different screen sizes.
